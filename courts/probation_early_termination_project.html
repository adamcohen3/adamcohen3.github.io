<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-eligibility">Estimating eligibility</h2>
<p>All active supervision cases with a start date after January 1st, 2015 were pulled from the Caseload Explorer database. This cutoff date was used because any active probationer under supervision for at least 10 years is likely ineligible for the study given that a term of that length would indicate a probationer committed a disqualifying offense or has an elevated risk level and hasn’t made sufficient progress on probation.</p>
<p>Halfway dates were estimated by finding the midpoint between the probation start date and expected probation end date. This was calculated by taking a simple difference between these two dates to get the number of days in the person’s probation term, dividing that by two, and then adding it to the start date.</p>
<p>If a probationer had multiple supervision cases and they had different halfway points, the latest (i.e., most recent or most in the future) halfway point was used.</p>
</section>
<section id="active-probationers-near-or-beyond-the-halfway-point" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="active-probationers-near-or-beyond-the-halfway-point">Active probationers near or beyond the halfway point</h2>
<p>First we look at all active probationers since 2015. Each point represents the number of active probationers during that month who reached the halfway point of their probation term. The shaded area represents all of those active probationers who are at or beyond the halfway point. Note that everyone left of the far right edge of the gray shaded region is past the halfway point, which came at some point in the past.</p>
<p>Halfway points before 2015 and after 2027 have been excluded as most reflect <a href="#sec-data-quality-issues">inaccurate start or end dates</a>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-number-of-probationers-reaching-the-halfway-point-not-about-the-same-each-month-or-why-isnt-the-line-more-flat">Why are number of probationers reaching the halfway point not about the same each month? Or, why isn’t the line more flat?</h3>
<p>It probably would be about the same each month if we were looking at all probationers. But the number of <em>active</em> probationers reaching the halfway point of their probation term is not likely to be the same each month for several reasons.</p>
<p>One likely reason for the lower counts further back in time is that many probationers who had a halfway point in the past are no longer on probation. They either had their probation revoked or they had shorter probation terms and are no longer on probation because they successfully completed their term. For example, a 4 year term with a halfway point in January of 2020 would have ended in 2022.</p>
<p>At the other end, one reason for the lower counts forward in time is that many people simply have not come onto probation yet who will have their halfway point at some point in the future. For example, a 4 year term with a halfway point in January of 2028 would not start until 2026.</p>
<p>Another reason for the peak is that, due to data entry lag, some percent of recent cases are closed but have not yet been terminated.</p>
<p>The steepness of the line around the date when the data was pulled is still a bit surprising, but it is expected to be the maximum value given we expect the number of people at the halfway point to fall off in both directions for the reasons above.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eligible-probationers-near-or-beyond-the-halfway-point">Eligible probationers near or beyond the halfway point</h2>
<p>Next we exclude any probationer with an excluded offense as defined in the Early Terimnation Criteria form drafted by the Probation Administrators:</p>
<ul>
<li>any felony conviction under HRS Chapter 707;</li>
<li>any felony Abuse of a Family or Household Member conviction under HRS 709-906(8) or (9);</li>
<li>any conviction under HRS 134;</li>
<li>any conviction under HRS 707 Part V-Sexual Offenses;</li>
<li>any conviction of Habitual DUI under HRS 291E-61.5;</li>
<li>any DAG/DANC or Conditional Discharge under HRS 706-622.5 or 706-622.9</li>
</ul>
<p>A probationer was deemed ineligible if they had at least one excluded offense across any active supervision cases.</p>
<p>This is an overestimate of the eligible group because it does not factor in all of the other eligibility criteria outlined by the Probation Adiministrators (see <a href="https://">form</a>). This subset of eligibles is plotted in <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.</p>

<p>There are <strong>1304</strong> active probationers who do not have an excluded offense and are within +/- 6 months of the halfway point of their probation term.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-data-quality-issues" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-data-quality-issues">Known data quality issues</h2>
<p>Several data quality issues came up while analyzing the data, including incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccurate data.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Missing disposition codes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Out of 18,015 charges pulled, there were 4,619 (~25%) missing a disposition code. To be as inclusive as possible, these were treated as if they were probation cases and included in the analysis. This may overestimate eligibles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Missing and inconsistent termination codes and termination dates</strong>
<ul>
<li>Out of 11,910 supervision cases, there were 2,736 (23%) with an “Expected End Date” that already passed. It’s possible that the “Expected End Date” was extended by the court, and that these people are still on probation, but the halfway dates on these supervision cases would be inaccurate.</li>
<li>It is possible the many cases with an end date in the past are terminated but the termination and termination date field are empty because they have not been updated due to data entry lag. This raises the possibility that the set of active probationers includes people who in fact are terminated. This would inflate estimates of active probationers and eligibles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate start and end dates</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several supervision cases had implausible start and/or end dates (e.g., 5202-09-05, 9999-01-09, 3023-10-30). There are also supervision cases in which the probation end date precedes the probation start date. This may affect the accuracy of these estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
