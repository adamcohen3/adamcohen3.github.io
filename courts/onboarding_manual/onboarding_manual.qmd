###	Day 1 Logistics

#### ID Badge and remaining HR forms

On the morning of your first day, you will meet with the Employee Services Division to pick up your ID badge and complete the Hawaii Residency form. The Research and Planning division head will schedule this meeting ahead of time and let you know when HR is expecting you.

####	Office Keys

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%"}

<br>
Supreme Court bailiff and jack-of-all trades Curt Shibata, whose versatility is only exceeded by his selflessness, will issue you office keys. Curt requires two actions before he hands over the keys: a) Reading the "Use for Keys" memo (see below) and b) Signing the key sign-out sheet. After you've read the memo, please email Curt at curt.m.shibata.

####	Computer, email, and network drives

Our IT Department will set up a network account for you that will allow you to log into most networked computers. They will also set up your email account.  

Your login username and password for computer/network access and email should be the same.

You should also have access to two network drives:  
**G Drive**: A common drive shared by all within a division/department.  Most users within a division/department have full rights to folders on G.  
**H Drive**: A drive for work related files. Only you and the server administrators have access.

Much of our collaborative work will also be stored on private repositories on Github and OSF.

###	Building 
![Ali`iolani Hale](aliiolani_hale.jpg){width=81% fig-align="center"}

We work here - not bad, right? [Ali'iolani Hale](https://hilo.hawaii.edu/wehe/?q=ali%CA%BBiolani), or more informally the Supreme Court Building, was built between 1871 and 1874. The building [celebrated](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/news_and_reports/2024/05/150-years-of-ali%CA%BBiolani-hale-celebrated-with-historical-re-enactment-tours) [its](https://historichawaii.org/2022/09/23/aliiolanihale-2-2/) [150th](https://www.jhchawaii.net/event/celebrating-150-years-of-law-and-justice-at-aliiolani-hale/) [birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wi_geJeLiI) in the spring of 2024. Here's our address:  

Hawai'i State Judiciary  
417 South King Street  
Honolulu, Hawai'i 96813

#### Hours

The building is open to the public from 7:45AM to 4:30PM. Outside of these hours, the doors lock, so if you need access to the building, make sure to have your badge, which doubles as a magnetic access card to the building. 

#### Entrances

There are three entrances. Checkpoint A is the front entrance facing King Street. Checkpoint B is on the Diamond Head side of the building, closer to Queen Street. Location C is also on the Diamond Head side but closer to King Street.

Note that in the pdf below, King Street is along the right side of the map and Queen Street the left.

###	Transportation and Parking

#### Buses
Ali'iolani Hale is conveniently located near several major bus stops. Two of the closest bus stops, at King and Punchbowl in front of the building and Queen and Mililani behind it, intersect with 43 routes. The Judiciary also offers a pre-tax bus pass, which brings down the effective cost of taking the bus.

![Bus stops near Ali`iolani Hale](busses_final.png)

For route information, visit <https://www.thebus.org/Route/Routes.asp>.

#### Biking

*Under construction!*

#### Parking
If taking a car, there are several options for parking in private garages.

* 345 Queen Street parking garage (monthly and daily parking rates, including early-bird rate)
* SP+ Parking garage along Halekauwila Street (unsure what kinds of rates are available)
* *under construction*

If you are unable to find a private garage with space, metered parking is available in front of the Territorial Building next to ours, in front of the post office between Merchant Street and King Street, along Mililani Street, and along Punchbowl Street. 

![Parking near Ali`iolani Hale](metered_parking.png)

There is parking available through the Judiciary, but there is a (very long) wait list. Kanani Kawika (katie.k.kawika@courts.hawaii.gov), the head secretary for the Administrative Director, manages the list. If you expect to drive, it may be worth putting your name down on the list.

###	Work hours, Holidays, and Electronic Leave System (ELS)

#### Work hours

Normal work hours are 7:45AM to 4:30PM. Many people work an alternate schedule, and this division supports alternate schedules so long as you are available for meetings, which typically occur during normal work hours.

#### Holiday calendar

![](State-Holidays-2024-2025.pdf){width=100% height=600px}


#### Electronic Leave System (ELS)
To submit a sick, vacation, or other request for time off, please use the internal [ELS portal](http://domapps01.courts.state.hi.us/Apps/ELS/PPD_ELS.nsf). As of October 2024, you must browse to it in an IE tab in Edge. The platform is old and does not work outside of IE. 

Here is an ELS orientation video courtesy of HR:

#### Advance notice when taking vacation
For longer vacation (3 days or more), please try to provide at least two weeks notice; for short vacation (1-2 days), at least 48 hours notice is fine. For a partial day, it is fine to give notice as late as the morning of. 

###	Dress policy
Please see the [dress policy](http://10.220.33.180/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/spac13.pdf).

Here is a video about the dress policy courtesy of HR:

###	Equipment, furniture, and office supplies
Please let us know if/when any of the furniture or equipment is not in good working order. We will try to order a replacement as soon as possible. It is important to us that you have what you need to work comfortably and successfully. Same goes for office supplies.

####	Computers: Hardware and software
This is, for better or worse, a Microsoft Windows institution. When it comes time to purchase new machines, we will discuss as a group what models to request. It has been relayed in the past that ITSD generally prefers uniformity in hardware as it helps them with troubleshooting. Customization (additional RAM or storage, GPUs, etc.) is definitely encouraged.

As a division, we aim to use FOSS. Proprietary software is always an option, especially when a FOSS alternative is either unavailable or not as developed.

####	Physical inventory
The Judiciary requires a yearly physical inventory of Judiciary purchased items. *Please let me know if things need to be moved around* (e.g., towers, monitors, printers, other equipment, furniture, large office supplies, etc.). I have to keep track of each item's location for the inventory.

###	Lunch/food
This division happens to know the best restaurants along the dimensions of quality and value and their intersection. This is classified information, not to be shared in this manual, but can be discussed in private. Beyond this top secret list, here are some lunchtime locations with multiple eateries:

* Eateries in Topa Tower
* Merchant Street Food Alley
* Eateries in Bishop Square
* Eateries along Fort Street Mall

###	Judictionary
*Under construction!*
A dictionary/encyclopedia for the seemingly bottomless list of terms, acronyms, abbreviations, codes, and other novel sounds you'll hear around the Judiciary. The tool is intended not just to decode but also to provide plain language descriptions for technical terms, legal or otherwise, you may come across at the Judiciary.

## Meeting people, visiting places

### Office neighbors in Ali`iolani Hale
During the first week, we will introduce you to as many people as possible in our building, making it nearly impossible to remember everyone's name although everyone will know yours. Some people you won't see as much as others, so don't hesitate to ask us for a reminder about someone's name.

Ali`iolani Hale houses the Policy and Planning Department (PPD), Criminal Justice Research Institute (CJRI), most of Intergovernmental and Community Relations Department (ICRD), and the office of the Administrative Director (ADC).

PPD includes 5 divisions:

* [Law Library](https://histatelawlibrary.com) (1st floor)
* [Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution](http://10.220.33.180/cadr/) (CADR)
* Communications and Community Relations (CCR)
* Office of the Staff Attorney

####	Tour of the Judicial History Center
The Judicial History Center (JHC) lives on the first floor of our building. We'll aim to tour the JHC in the first month so that you can learn about the rich history of the Judiciary in Hawai`i. Please check our their [website](https://www.jhchawaii.net/).

###	Legislative hearings
After the legislative session starts, we will head over to the Hawai`i State Capitol to attend hearings of the [House Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/committeepage.aspx?comm=JHA) and the [Senate Judiciary Committee](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/committeepage.aspx?comm=JDC) so you can learn about how the Judiciary and the Legislature work together to revise bills that create or amend law and shape an appropriation (funding) bill.

###	Court observation
Over the first year, we will make regular visits to the courts so that you can learn about court operations, legal procedure, and issues surrounding data entry.  It is a valuable opportunity to meet people on the court side and establish relationships with them.

* Circuit Court Criminal
* Circuit Court Civil
* District Court Criminal
* District Court Civil
* District Court Traffic (crim and non-crim)
* Specialty Courts (Drug, Mental Health, and Veterans Treatment Court)
* Appellate Courts

We will also visit the court operations and client services (probation) offices to learn about their work.

## Research at the Judiciary
### Our research circle

Here are some names that are helpful to know as we frequently work with them. Our circle has grown over the past 5 years and we hope it will continue to expand as we establish new collaborations. Depending on their availability, we will try to schedule meetings with the people below over your first few months.

We also interact with the [National Center for State Courts](https://www.ncsc.org/) and the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/).

### Judiciary Case Management Systems (CMS) and databases

The primary data system for court records is known as the Judiciary Information Management System (JIMS). The GUI is known as [**JIMS Portal**](http://jimsicc1.courts.state.hi.us/JIMSWeb/login.iface) and the underlying database, which we interact with regularly for extracting data, is known as the **JIMS Oracle Database** (Oracle 19c as of May 2024). The "reporting" database we have access to is in fact a mirror of the JIMS Production database, and it is on a one day delay compared to the Production database, so new court activity does not appear until the next day. We use Oracle SQL Developer as our IDE (version 23.1.1.345 as of 2024/11/04; <span style="color:red;">N.B.: There is a major bug in v24.3.0.284 that prevents exporting query results to xlsx or csv</span>).

:::
A JIMS user ID and password are needed to access JIMS Portal. Setup is also required to access the underlying database. If these are not already set up when you start, or you have login issues, please notify the division head.

We rely on data from a number of other databases, including **Trust Accounting (TA)**, which stores data on fines, fees, and restitution, and rests on a Cobol-based system, and [**Caseload Explorer (CE)**](http://apdvoca2/CaseloadExplorer/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fCaseloadExplorer%2fTreeView.aspx), which is the case management system used by Probation. The underlying database for CE is called **CX** and we use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 19 as our IDE. You may need access to these at some point depending on what projects you lead.

### JIRA and Sharepoint/Confluence: Issue tracking and Knowledge Base
***Under construction! Discuss dual role of JIRA for our division -> submit and receive tickets ***

ITSD uses [JIRA Cloud](https://hawaiijudiciary.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) for issue-tracking. Whenever you submit a ticket, it goes to their helpdesk, who direct the ticket to the appropriate IT staff. ***Whenever you have a hardware, software, or database issue, first share it with the division to see if we can resolve it before bringing it to ITSD.*** A ticket is a last, not a first, resort.

How do I submit a ticket? Submit an email to <helpdesk.requests@courts.hawaii.gov> with your issue.

In December of 2023, the Judiciary transitioned from [JIRA on-prem](https://jira.courts.state.hi.us:8443/secure/Dashboard.jspa) to JIRA Cloud. The JIRA on-prem is archived and contains a wealth of information on old projects. Having an account to the historical tickets will likely be useful.  

When the Judiciary switched to JIRA Cloud, it also stopped supporting [Confluence](<http://confluence.courts.state.hi.us:8090/>), which had been used for project management and as a knowledge base for JIMS and other applications. It also served as a hub for group forums. Having access to this will also likely be useful.  

Project management is now handled by [Sharepoint](<https://courtshawaii.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx>).
